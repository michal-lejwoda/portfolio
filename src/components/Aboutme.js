                with a master's degree and currently i am trying to expand my programming skills. As a self-taught
                programmer, I quickly grasp new technologies and frameworks. While i have experience with front end
                frameworks like React, my true passion and preference lie in back end development especially using
                Python and Django framework. As a persistent and conscientious person in pursuit of my goals, I develop my passion with daily, systematic work.
