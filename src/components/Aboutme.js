                degree in computer science and i am currently trying to expand my programming skills. As a self-taught
                programmer, I quickly grasp new technologies and frameworks, while i have experience with frontend
                frameworks like React. My true passion and preference lie in backend development especially using Python
                and Django framework. As a persistent and conscientious person in pursuit of my goals, I develop
                my passion with daily, systematic work. In my free time, I like to do sports such as running or training
                at the gym. I also like to play computer games doesn't matter if it is big-budget or an indie game.The
                only kind of games that I can't convince myself to play are jrpg games :(
